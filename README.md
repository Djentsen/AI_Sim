## AI_Sim
A 2D top-down work-in-progress simulation where actions are dictated by the ChatGPT model of your choosing through an API Key.

## AI Society Simulation

An AI-driven micro-society simulation where an autonomous agent evolves and governs a 2D environment. Built in Python using Pygame and OpenAI’s API, this project explores how artificial intelligence can manipulate, adapt, and learn from its world to create optimized outcomes — with zero human interaction.

## THIS IS A VERY EARLY WORK-IN-PROGRESS

This project is VERY early on in its development. I have spent a lot of hours getting it to where it is but I am well aware that is it still quite under developed. However, I wanted to share this to serve as a base for others to experiment with. AI is a brand new frontier! This project is meant to experiment with LLM logic when put in different situations. In its current state, the population of lifeforms seems to stagnate around 4-6 members, I am continuing to work on balancing how the lifeforms repopulate, gather food, and gather water. Currently food is generated by the code, not the AI agent. Food and water have a scent so that lifeforms can find resources needed for life. All lifeforms can carry a certain amount of food and water, and they also have a maximum lifespan. Base spawning is a very new work-in-progress. Currently there is one base that is static on the map. In time, the AI agent will have full control over where the base or bases will be placed. I also plan to add different colors of lifeforms to introduce some social dynamics into the sim.

All interactions I've had with the sim has been through VS Code

If anyone has any questions, ideas, or anything else in between, feel free to reach out! I would love to collaborate on this project, as well as any others like it.

## Purpose

This simulation serves as a sandbox for observing emergent behavior and decision-making in AI. The AI "leader" is empowered to create lifeforms, alter environments, and evolve strategies based on the outcomes of previous simulation runs. Each run wipes memory of all but the last generation, encouraging adaptive learning through iteration.

## Key Features

- **Top-down 2D simulation** built with Pygame  
- **AI agent powered by OpenAI API** (manual or automated prompts)  
- Dynamic **food, scent, and terrain systems**  
- Color-coded **lifeforms with hunger, thirst, and reproduction logic**  
- **Group home bases** with shared food storage  
- **Scent trails and tracking behavior**  
- AI-directed **code-based actions** (spawning, modifying environment, increasing resources)  
- Reproduction and death tied to environmental and resource factors  
- **Learning system**: AI receives previous run data to refine its next attempt
